### Factors to Collect for Water Resource Management Project

1. **Climate Data:**
   - Precipitation patterns
   - Temperature variations
   - Evapotranspiration rates

2. **Groundwater Data:**
   - Groundwater levels
   - Aquifer recharge rates
   - Water quality parameters (pH, contaminants)

3. **Soil Data:**
   - Soil moisture content
   - Soil type and composition
   - Land cover and land use

4. **Hydrological Data:**
   - River/stream flow rates
   - Watershed boundaries
   - Floodplain mapping

5. **Crop Data:**
   - Crop types and distribution
   - Crop health and growth stages
   - Agricultural practices and irrigation methods

6. **Remote Sensing Data:**
   - **Satellite Imagery:**
      - Landsat: For land cover, vegetation health, and change detection.
      - Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2: For monitoring floods, soil moisture, and crop health.
      - MODIS: For climate and vegetation monitoring on a broader scale.

   - **Radar Data:**
      - SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar): Useful for flood mapping and monitoring soil moisture.

   - **LiDAR Data:**
      - High-resolution elevation data for accurate terrain mapping.

   - **Vegetation Indices:**
      - NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index): Indicates vegetation health.

   - **Thermal Infrared Imagery:**
      - Measures surface temperatures, which can be useful for water temperature and evapotranspiration studies.

   - **Land Surface Temperature (LST) Data:**
      - Indicates the temperature of the Earth's surface.
